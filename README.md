# pomodoro-timer
My Version of a Pomodoro-Timer written in Python and Bash.

The length of the intervals can be adjusted in the mail.py file.
The current status of the session is displayed in real time in the terminal.
After the time of the respective session is over a notification is sent.
To start just execute main.py. To go from a pomodoro session to the pause session, or vice versa, just press enter in the terminal.
The length of each completed pomodoro session is automatically written to the pomodoro_history.txt file at the end of each session.
